# ray-tracing
A ray tracer in rust heavily inspired by the Ray Tracing in One Weekend book series.

# Running
Unfortunately there is no configuration file yet, so you'll have to manually edit the code - although there should already be a default scene. After that, simply `cargo run --release`
- the release is important of course :)

# Example
